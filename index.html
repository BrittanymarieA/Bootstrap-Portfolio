                    I am about 25% nerd, 25% fun lover, and 50% goofball; however, dog mom is my main career, and I
                    have a
                    malamute husky mix. His name is Barry, after Barry Allen the Flash. He is full of so much energy,
                    and
                    is
                    always wanting my attention. It can be aggrivating, but I love him. He is the reason I became a dog
                    handler
                    at a dog hotel. We both love it there, and we have made so many friendships with all the dogs. We
                    even
                    have
                    our favorites.

                    I also love super hero's, video games, and anime. I feel super heros's and anime have impacted so
                    much
                    on
                    me. They are constantly fighting huge conflicts involving morality, and I have been exposed to
                    these
                    stories most of my adolecent life. That is why I feel they impacted me, because I believe they
                    helped
                    me
                    evolve and understand my own beliefs. Video games have helped me enjoy problem solving, and grow a
                    love
                    and
                    hate relationship with persistance. On one hand I will not give up on a puzzle no matter how many
                    times
                    I
                    reset it, but on another it feels like I am in purgatory resetting an unsolvable problem. Despite
                    that
                    I
                    will always enjoy the different lives, adventures, and lessons. I get to experience this all from
                    my
                    bedroom on a screen, and to me that seems like wizardry.
